# Pulsar Research Portal for the Visually Impaired

NANOGrav project helmed by Pranet Sharma and Dr. Maura McLaughlin working to develop the first accessible pulsar research interface for the visually impaired.

National Radio Astronomy Observatory GBT data files are in `raw_data`, along with prepfold plots and sonified plots. Scripts to sonify pulsar data are in `sonification`. Portal pages are in `website`.
